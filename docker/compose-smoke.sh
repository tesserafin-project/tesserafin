#
# Runs the canonical docker-compose.yml from an ISOLATED directory that contains
# ONLY the compose file + env example (no repo source), proving the zero-friction
# path: pull the immutable image, boot, REACH THE FIRST-RUN WIZARD IN A BROWSER
# and complete onboarding, survive a restart, keep state across container
# recreation, enforce read-only media, and keep named volumes on `down`.
# Requires NO source compilation.
#
# WHY THE BROWSER PART EXISTS (#115)
#
#   The first version of this script asserted only that `/System/Info/Public`
#   answered, and it passed against an image that ran with `--nowebclient` and
#   served the Swagger API documentation at `/` — no onboarding wizard existed at
#   all. API reachability is not browser-installability. The gates below fail on
#   any such image, and the real browser run is delegated to
#   docker/browser-onboarding.sh's Playwright suite so the two paths share one
#   definition of "onboarded".
#
# Usage: docker/compose-smoke.sh [host-port]
