/// no <c>startTimeTicks</c> property, and its <c>expected.output</c> object has no
/// <c>subtitleFormat</c> property, both because those fields describe pipeline behavior the lab does
/// not model. Every other field here matches its domain counterpart name-for-name (only camelCased
/// by <see cref="PlaybackCompatFixtureExporter.Options"/> at serialization time) - see
/// <see cref="PlaybackCompatFixtureExporter"/> for the field-by-field derivation.

/// <param name="FixtureVersion">The fixture schema version this export targets. Always <c>5</c>.</param>
/// <param name="Id">A schema-conformant (<c>^[a-z0-9-]+$</c>) id derived from the source session id.</param>
/// <param name="Category">
/// A best-guess compatibility-lab category (see <see cref="PlaybackCompatFixtureExporter"/> remarks) -
/// a real production case does not self-classify into the lab's curated category vocabulary, so this
/// is a heuristic starting point for the admin to correct before adding the export to the curated
/// fixture catalog, not an authoritative classification.
