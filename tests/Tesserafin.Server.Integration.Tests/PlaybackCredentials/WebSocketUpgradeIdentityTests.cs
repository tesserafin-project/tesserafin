/// <remarks>
/// WHAT R2 LEFT OPEN. R2 proved a ticket authenticates an upgrade, is single-use, and is never
/// rescued by a durable token. It did not prove what the upgrade does with the binding the ticket
/// carries. The frozen candidate resolves the bound session with
/// <c>Sessions.FirstOrDefault(...)</c> and then reads its client, version and device name through
/// <c>?.</c>, so a ticket naming a session that is no longer live produces an authenticated
/// connection carrying three empty strings — and an empty client and device id are a DIFFERENT
/// session key, so the socket attaches to a session the ticket was never issued for. The same
/// shape holds for a user id that no longer resolves.
///
/// HOW ACCEPTANCE IS OBSERVED, AND WHY NOT THE WATCHLIST. R2's discriminator was
/// <c>SessionWebSocketListener</c>'s watchlist. That instrument cannot grade R3's cases: the
/// watchlist is filled inside <c>KeepAliveWebSocket</c>, downstream of
/// <c>RequestHelpers.GetSession</c>, so a socket that IS accepted and then dies resolving its
/// session leaves the watchlist untouched and is indistinguishable from a refusal. Every hostile
/// control this file names produces exactly that shape. <see cref="UpgradeRecorder"/> is therefore
/// the load-bearing instrument here — it records inside the same listener loop, before anything can
/// throw — and the watchlist is asserted alongside it rather than instead of it.
