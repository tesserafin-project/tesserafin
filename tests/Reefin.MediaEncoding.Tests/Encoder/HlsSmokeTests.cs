/// PR115d, scope item 4 ("smoke tests ffmpeg/HLS in Docker"): a real, end-to-end proof that ffmpeg
/// can actually produce a playable HLS manifest and segments in whatever environment runs this test -
/// exactly the mechanic the v2 canary's live streaming path (<c>DynamicHlsController</c>, driven by
/// whichever <c>StreamInfo</c> <c>MediaInfoHelper.ResolveServedStreamInfo</c> served, legacy or v2)
/// ultimately depends on.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Be precise about what this proves and what it does not.</b> This test runs a real ffmpeg
/// process, through <see cref="FfmpegProcessRunner"/> - the same production process-running component
/// <c>TranscodeManager.StartFfMpeg</c> uses - with a hand-built <c>testsrc</c>/<c>sine</c> lavfi
/// source (no real media file needed, so this has zero test-asset dependency) and asserts a real
/// `.m3u8` manifest plus at least one real, non-empty `.ts` segment land on disk. What it does NOT
/// prove: that this is the exact command line <c>EncodingHelper</c> would build for a real client
/// request, or that the v2/legacy serve-or-fallback DECISION (kill switch, canary cohort, the PR115d
/// stop-threshold guard) actually routes to this command line over a real HTTP connection - see
/// <c>ci/smoke.sh</c>'s own header comment for the full honesty statement, including why a genuine
/// attempt at booting the full server in Docker for this proof was not carried through (no existing
/// test harness in this repo provisions a library/media item/auth token; the only full-server harness,
/// <c>tests/Reefin.Server.Integration.Tests/ReefinApplicationFactory.cs</c>, explicitly disables
/// ffmpeg validation for its own tests). The v2/legacy DECISION and the admin diagnostics endpoint are
/// separately, thoroughly covered at the unit level by <c>MediaInfoHelperLiveWiringTests</c> and
/// <c>PlaybackDiagnosticsMetricsControllerTests</c> - <c>ci/smoke.sh</c> runs both alongside this test.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Tagged <c>Category=Smoke</c> so <c>ci/run.sh</c> (the mandatory merge gate) can exclude it by
/// default - PR115d's scope explicitly asks for this to be optional/non-blocking, unlike every other
/// ffmpeg-touching test in this suite (for example <c>EncoderValidatorTests</c>), which already run
/// unconditionally as part of the normal gate. This one is kept separate because synthesizing and
/// segmenting two real seconds of video is meaningfully heavier than a version-string probe.
