/// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. R4 Phase 2 measured that <c>IHlsJobOwnershipAuthorizer.OwnsJob</c> — the
/// only member this route uses, and the only member no byte-serving route uses — could be neutered
/// to <c>return true</c>, or its call site rewritten to <c>if (job is null)</c>, and the entire
/// <c>LiveTvSegmentOwnership</c> suite stayed at 69/69 green. For one of the twelve job-backed
/// routes the authorizer was exactly what the mission forbids: mentioned in a registry and asserted
/// nowhere.
///
/// WHY THE STATUS CODE PROVES NOTHING HERE, AND WHAT IS ASSERTED INSTEAD. This route answers
/// <c>204 No Content</c> to every caller by design: a job the caller does not own answers exactly
/// as one that never existed, so that the route cannot be used as a probe for which play sessions
/// are live. A test that asserted the status code would therefore pass with the authorization
/// removed. What separates authorized from refused is whether the transcode was actually ENDED —
/// so every row below asserts the 204 AND the recorded effect: whether
/// <c>KillTranscodingJobs</c> was called, and with which arguments.
///
/// WHAT <c>OwnsJob</c> COMPARES, STATED PLAINLY. It compares identity only: the caller's user id
/// and the caller's device, resolved exactly as the job's own owner was recorded. It receives no
/// binding, because this route has no item, no media source and no play-session binding to compare
/// against — the job is selected from server state by the caller-named <c>playSessionId</c>, and
/// what the authorizer then decides is whether this caller is that job's owner. The capability rows
/// below are therefore contradictions of IDENTITY (another user, another device's session, a
/// capability nothing validated), which are the contradictions this route can see.
