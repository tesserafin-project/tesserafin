/// start outcomes on v2-served sessions - the operational gate that must exist before
/// <see cref="Tesserafin.Model.Configuration.PlaybackShadowOptions.CanaryPercentage"/> is opened above 0
/// in production. Mirrors <see cref="Tesserafin.Playback.Shadow.ShadowMetrics"/>'s conventions
/// deliberately: one singleton shared across every live request, <see cref="Interlocked"/> rather
/// than a lock (this sits on the same hot playback-decision/streaming path ShadowMetrics already
/// avoids allocating or blocking on), and a separate immutable <see cref="PlaybackOperationalMetricsSnapshot"/>
/// for readers (tests, the admin diagnostics endpoint, <c>PlaybackStopThresholdGuard</c>).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Served/fallback counters.</b> Every call <c>MediaInfoHelper.ResolveServedStreamInfo</c> makes
/// funnels through exactly two recording methods - <see cref="RecordServed"/> on the one success
/// path, <see cref="RecordFallback"/> (parameterized by the typed
/// <see cref="PlaybackLiveFallbackReason"/>) on every failure path - so these counters can never
/// drift out of sync with what <see cref="IPlaybackLiveWiringDiagnosticsStore"/> retains per session;
/// they are the cumulative, cross-session view of the same decision that store retains per-session.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Transcode start counters - what "start failure" means here.</b> <c>PlaybackSessionManager</c>
/// observes <see cref="ITranscodeManager.TranscodingJobStarted"/>/<see cref="ITranscodeManager.TranscodingJobEnded"/>
/// (already wired since PR113b) and calls <see cref="RecordTranscodeStart"/> exactly once per
/// transcoding job whose play session correlates to a currently-tracked, v2-served session: a
/// "start failure" is a job that ended (<c>TranscodingJobEnded</c>) without ever having raised
/// <c>TranscodingJobStarted</c> first - ffmpeg's <c>Process.Start()</c> itself never succeeded, per
/// that event's own contract ("never for a job that failed to start"). A job that started
/// successfully and later failed mid-stream is deliberately NOT counted here: that is a different
/// failure mode (a running ffmpeg process dying), outside PR115d's "did the v2 plan even produce
/// something ffmpeg could launch" scope, and conflating the two would make the transcode-start-failure
/// rate a much noisier, less specific signal for the stop-threshold guard to act on.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why the success is recorded at Started, not inferred at Ended.</b> A naive implementation would
/// record both outcomes when the job ends, by checking whether a Started was ever observed. That has
/// a directional bias: a session can be evicted (<c>PlaybackStopped</c>, the TTL sweep) strictly
/// between its job's Started and Ended events, and a job that never started at all produces no
/// playback and therefore never triggers <c>PlaybackStopped</c> in the first place - so a naive
/// Ended-time check would silently drop successes (evicted before Ended, correlation lost) far more
/// often than failures (which are not exposed to that eviction path), inflating the observed failure
/// rate upward. <c>PlaybackSessionManager</c> avoids this by recording a success immediately when
/// Started fires (the session is provably still tracked at that instant - it is the very job whose
/// launch is being reported) and only checking "was this one ever started" at Ended time, to record a
/// failure when it was not. Either half can still be silently dropped when correlation is lost before
/// EITHER event fires (a job the session manager never planned) - a best-effort signal, not a hard
/// guarantee - but that residual gap is symmetric, not a bias toward either outcome.
