/// applies exactly two gates to a durable principal — remote access when off the local network,
/// and the parental schedule — and succeeds an administrator outright. None of those is job
/// ownership, and an administrator passes every permission policy in this server because
/// <c>UserPermissionRequirement</c> subclasses <c>DefaultAuthorizationRequirement</c>. So a second
/// authenticated user read the first user's live segment bytes. The comparison has to happen here,
/// against the job, and it admits no exemption for a role, for remote access or for the local
/// network.
///
/// TWO CREDENTIALS, NEVER ONE FALLING BACK ON THE OTHER. If a capability was presented, the
/// capability decides — and if it does not match the job the answer is a refusal, not a second

/// no capability at all.

/// finding F7). What a stop — <c>DELETE Videos/ActiveEncodings</c>, a teardown, a reap — actually
/// does to a request in progress was measured by R4 Phase 4b: an already-authorized read, whose job
/// was killed at 274 ms, still answered 200 with 93 228 bytes at 330 ms. That is accepted, and this
/// is the semantics it is accepted under:
///
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>THE LINEARIZATION POINT is the successful authorization decision taken while the job's
/// binding still exists. <see cref="Decide"/> resolves the binding once and returns it inside the
/// decision, so everything downstream reads that snapshot and never the registry again.</item>
/// <item>A REQUEST PAST THAT POINT MAY FINISH SENDING. Its bytes were authorized when the decision
/// was taken; the stop does not reach back into a response already in flight.</item>
/// <item>THE STOP REMOVES THE BINDING FOR EVERY NEW REQUEST. The job leaves the registry, so the
/// next <see cref="Decide"/> resolves nothing.</item>
/// <item>NO NEW OPENING CAN BE AUTHORIZED AFTERWARDS. <c>NoSuchJob</c> carries no binding at all,
/// and a refusal carries none either, so a request that arrives after the stop has no path to
/// open — not even to a residual file still on disk.</item>
/// <item>NO BINDING IS EVER RECREATED, AND THERE IS NO FALLBACK. The historical resolution — name a
/// file in the shared transcode folder — is gone. R4 Phase 4c measured the stronger fact that the
/// stop also deletes the residual segments: 88 files on disk, zero afterwards, the dead job's
/// deepest segment reachable by nobody including its own owner.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// WHO CAN EVER BE IN THAT STATE. Only the job's own owner. A non-owner is refused AT the
/// linearization point and therefore never has an authorized request to leave in flight, which is
/// why completing one is a liveness property rather than a hole. The four interlocks are pinned by
/// <c>InFlightRevocationTests</c>.
