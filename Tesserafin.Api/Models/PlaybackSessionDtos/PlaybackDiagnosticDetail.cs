/// The richer, admin-only diagnostic projection of a tracked playback session
/// (docs/pr92-design-playback-api-and-diagnostics.md §4.3, PR113): every

/// one was retained at all.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Filtering rule (§4.3, tested in PR113): never a file path, transcoding URL, session token, or API
/// key. Every field here is either a primitive, or drawn from the <see cref="Tesserafin.Playback.Decision"/>
/// vocabulary (PR91) or the shadow comparison vocabulary (<see cref="DivergenceClass"/>, PR98) - never
/// <c>Tesserafin.Model.Dlna.MediaSourceInfo</c>, <c>StreamInfo</c>, <c>DeviceProfile</c>, or the internal
/// <c>Tesserafin.Controller.MediaEncoding.PlaybackSession</c>/<c>PlaybackSessionRequest</c> records. See
/// <see cref="PlaybackDiagnosticDetailMapper"/> for the derivation.

/// Issue #43: the opaque, client-supplied attempt id recorded on this session, or
