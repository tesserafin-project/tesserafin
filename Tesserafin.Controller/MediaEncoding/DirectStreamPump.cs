/// session, no api key and no user - fetched it over HTTP. That endpoint is <c>[Authorize]</c>, so
/// the fetch answered 401 and every Live TV transcode died with ffmpeg exit code 8.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The fix is not to weaken that endpoint. The server already holds the open tuner stream in
/// process; handing ffmpeg a file descriptor it can read is the same trust boundary as handing it a
/// path to a library file, which is what every non-live transcode already does. No credential, no
/// token and no capability is minted, transmitted or persisted: the authorization decision was
/// taken once, by the authenticated request that opened the live stream, and the pipe carries only
/// the bytes that decision already authorized. <c>/LiveTv/LiveStreamFiles/**</c> keeps its
/// <c>[Authorize]</c> and its external behaviour unchanged.

/// Ownership is explicit. The pump owns both streams and disposes them when it ends; it ends
