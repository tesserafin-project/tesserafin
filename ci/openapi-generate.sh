# Regenerate the committed OpenAPI contract — Docker, local, no hosted CI.
#
# Why this exists: hosted GitHub Actions quota has been exhausted since
# ~2026-07-06, so "OpenAPI Check" (.github/workflows/openapi-pull-request.yml)
# and "OpenAPI Generate" (.github/workflows/openapi-generate.yml) do not run on
# real PRs. ./ci/run.sh is the only live merge gate. This script is the local
# replacement for the generate half; the verify half runs inside ci/run.sh as
# OpenApiContractTests. See docs/openapi-contract.md.
#
# What it produces (both committed, both regenerated together):
#   openapi/openapi.json       canonical contract document
#   openapi/contract.lock.json {version, sha256} pin sidecar
#
# Determinism: the document is canonicalised before being written (object keys
# sorted, host-dependent `servers` dropped, LF, 2-space indent, trailing
# newline) — see tests/Tesserafin.Server.Integration.Tests/OpenApiContract.cs. Two
# runs of this script from a clean tree produce byte-identical files. Verify
# with:
#   ./ci/openapi-generate.sh && sha256sum openapi/openapi.json
#   ./ci/openapi-generate.sh && sha256sum openapi/openapi.json
#
# Usage:
#   ./ci/openapi-generate.sh
