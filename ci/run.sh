# Why this exists (issue #62): GitHub refuses to allocate a hosted runner for
# this PRIVATE repo BEFORE the first step — the all3f0r1 account's 2000 free
# Actions minutes/month are account-wide and exhausted (~2646 weighted minutes
# in July 2026, drained mostly by another repo), and the spending limit is $0,
# so the overage is refused rather than billed. No self-hosted runner is
# registered either (total_count: 0). Until a human raises the spending limit,
# makes the repo public, or registers a runner with the labels
# self-hosted,linux,x64,reefin, this script IS the mandatory merge gate.
#
# This script purges every bin/ and obj/ in the checkout ITSELF, before the
# first compilation, and refuses to build if that purge did not complete
# (#94). The caller has no prerequisite to remember and no way to skip it:
# there is no flag for that. See ci/lib/clean-artifacts.sh for the contract
# and docs/local-ci.md ("Porte de référence") for why it matters.
# This script takes no arguments.
#
# What it does: builds the tesserafin-ci image from Dockerfile.ci (repo root),
# then runs `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` for the full solution inside a
# container. The repository is bind-mounted (not copied) so the container
# always tests the CURRENT checkout on disk — whatever branch is out,
# uncommitted changes included — which is what makes this script a valid
# gate for any branch.
#
# PR115d: the test run below excludes anything tagged Category=Smoke - today that is
# tests/Tesserafin.MediaEncoding.Tests/Encoder/HlsSmokeTests.cs, a real ffmpeg/HLS synthesis test that is
# meaningfully heavier than the rest of this suite and was scoped as an OPTIONAL, non-blocking stage.
# Run it explicitly with ./ci/smoke.sh (also Docker-based, same image) - see that script's header for
# exactly what it proves and does not prove.
#
# Issue #36 / openapi: the OpenAPI contract drift check is part of the dotnet test stage below, not a
# separate step here - OpenApiContractTests (tests/Tesserafin.Server.Integration.Tests) fails this gate
# when openapi/openapi.json no longer matches what the server produces, and its failure message
# names the fix (./ci/openapi-generate.sh). Keeping it inside the suite means it reuses the server
# boot the suite already pays for, and leaves this script unchanged in structure and runtime.
# See docs/openapi-contract.md.
#
# Issue #174 / [C3]: the PROVIDER-AUTHENTICATION structural audit is likewise part of the dotnet test
# stage below rather than a separate step. ProviderAuthAuditTests (tests/Tesserafin.Providers.Tests)
# reads ci/provider-auth-inventory.json and the COMPILED Tesserafin.Providers.dll and fails this gate
# when a third-party provider credential is compiled in, when a provider's outbound host or string
# constant is undeclared, or when an inventory entry describes a code path that no longer exists.
# It uses no entropy or length threshold: two of the three credentials this project inherited were
# six and eight characters long, so it identifies a credential by WHERE it is used, not by what it
# looks like. Gitleaks is complementary and does not cover this — it reported the contaminated image
# as clean, because the values were .NET const strings in the UTF-16LE metadata heap.
# See docs/provider-auth-audit.md.
#
# Issue #93 / [A7]: the server<->web RELEASE PAIR is deliberately NOT checked here.
# ci/verify-release-pair.sh needs a published image, a tesserafin-web checkout and a
# real browser; requiring all three would make ordinary server-only development
# depend on a neighbouring web checkout. It is a separate, explicitly invoked
# gate — see the note printed in SUMMARY below and
# docs/container/A7-server-web-release-pair.md.
#
# Issue #153-LTV-R9: the Live TV hostile-control grader proves itself here too, host-side, after the
# container stage - ci/hostile-controls/prove-undeclared-reporting.py and

# ── THE W1 RETENTION TRUST ROOT (#236, W1-A4-R4) ────────────────────────────
#
# THIS SCRIPT IS THE TRUST ROOT FOR THE W1 RETENTION CONTRACT, and these three
# constants are the part of it that no other file may restate. They are the
# THIRD party to an agreement that used to have two.
#
# Until R4 the expected roster lived in exactly two places: the orchestrator
# `ci/windows/runtime-retention/retention_gates.py`, which declares what it
# runs, and `ci/windows/verify-retention-gate-pinned.py`, which froze what it
# must run. Independent review (R3, finding F3) showed that is a bilateral
# agreement and can be weakened on both sides at once: delete a member from the
# orchestrator, delete the matching entry from the verifier's frozen tuple, and
# every check still agrees with every other check.
#
# The roster is now a versioned canonical manifest — a data file, outside both
# of those — and the values that AUTHENTICATE that manifest are here:
#
#   W1A4_ROSTER_MANIFEST_SHA256  the manifest's exact content digest.
#   W1A4_ROSTER_IDS              the fourteen member identities, in order.
#
# The verifier CONSUMES the manifest and READS these two constants out of this
# file. It cannot redefine either, because neither is written down where it can
# reach. Editing the manifest without editing this file is a digest mismatch;
# editing both is an edit to ci/run.sh, which is the merge gate for every
# branch and is reviewed as one.
#
# Nothing pins ci/run.sh in turn, and nothing should: a chain of scripts each
# pinning the next has no last link. That is the trust boundary, and it is
# stated here rather than hidden behind one more file.

# WHY THIS BLOCK IS HERE, AT THE TOP, AND NOT NEXT TO THE OTHER SELF-PROOFS.
#
# R3 finding F4: the block used to sit near the end of this script, after
# `STATUS=$?`, and the only thing that proved it ran was a control that
# EXTRACTED it and executed the extracted text on its own. Extracting a block
# and running it separately proves the block works. It proves nothing about
# whether ci/run.sh reaches it — moving the intact block below `exit "$STATUS"`
# passed that control unchanged.
#
# So the block is now the FIRST thing this script executes after its prologue.
# Only comments, blank lines, simple assignments, `cd`, `source` and closed
# function definitions may precede it, and `verify-retention-gate-pinned.py`
# refuses this file if anything else does. Nothing before it can exit, return,
# disable errexit, open a conditional, open a subshell or dispatch a test, so
# there is no reachable path through this script that skips it.
#
# It is fail-closed by `exit 1`, not by folding into $STATUS: $STATUS does not
# exist yet, and an accumulated status can be reassigned by a later stage.
#
# The interpreter is absolute and the environment is emptied by `/usr/bin/env
# -i` before python3 starts, so neither a shell function named `python3`, nor
# PATH, nor BASH_ENV, nor any PYTHON* variable inherited from the caller can
# decide what actually runs.
#
# `gate-roster-controls.py` proves both halves: STRUCTURALLY, that this block
# is top-level and unconditional and that nothing precedes it; and DYNAMICALLY,
# by running this script with a stubbed verifier and requiring the sentinel
# below to appear, the run to fail, and the build stage never to be reached.
# Keep the markers.
