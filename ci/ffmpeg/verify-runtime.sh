# Portability and licence contract for a built Tesserafin FFmpeg runtime
# (F0 / #229).
#
# Usage: ci/ffmpeg/verify-runtime.sh --stage DIR --arch RID [--manifest OUT.json]
#
# Inspects the produced binaries rather than the build that made them. What it
# refuses:
#   * an RPATH or RUNPATH naming Jellyfin, a build workspace or a host path;
#   * a DT_NEEDED entry that ci/ffmpeg/allowed-dt-needed.txt does not document;
#   * an embedded build-host path;
#   * a GLIBC symbol version above the declared floor;
#   * a wrong ELF machine for the architecture;
#   * a nonfree or unredistributable licence, or any trace of libfdk_aac.
#
# With --manifest it also writes the capability record: version, buildconf and
# the full encoder/decoder/filter/protocol/hwaccel surface. That record states
# compiled capability only. It makes no runtime hardware claim, because listing
# an encoder proves it was compiled in and nothing more.

# its dispatcher from its compiled-in prefix and OpenSSL reads openssl.cnf from
# its own.
#
# The scan reads the binaries, not the build logs, and it distinguishes a
# compiled-in DIRECTORY PREFIX from an ordinary runtime path. `/tmp/%sXXXXXX` is
