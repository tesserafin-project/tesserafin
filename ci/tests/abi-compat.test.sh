# Deterministic controls for the fail-closed ABI gate (#94).
#
# Every control below is a synthetic class library built in a throwaway tree
# under $TMPDIR — never in the repository checkout, and never part of
# Tesserafin.sln, the server build graph or the public ABI. That isolation is
# deliberate: the repository root Directory.Build.props turns all warnings
# into errors and, in Debug, injects the Tesserafin.CodeAnalysis analyzer, so
# a fixture project generated inside the checkout would fail for reasons that
# have nothing to do with ABI compatibility.
#
# The point of these controls is that a green ABI job means something. The
# previous workflow ran ApiCompat with `|| true`, so it stayed green through
# missing files, tool crashes and real breaking changes alike. Each RED case
# here proves one specific way the gate must refuse to pass; each GREEN case
# proves it does not cry wolf.
#
# Usage:
#   ./ci/tests/abi-compat.test.sh
#
# Requires the .NET SDK and the pinned tool manifest (`dotnet tool restore`).
