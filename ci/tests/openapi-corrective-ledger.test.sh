# Break controls for the one-shot corrective-transition ledger (#226, PR #227).
#
# A ledger that has never been observed REFUSING is not evidence that it can
# refuse. Every case below mutates one thing about an otherwise-accepted
# transition and requires the gate to stop accepting it. A control that
# unexpectedly passes fails this suite.
#
# Two layers:
#
#   consumer  ci/openapi-corrective-ledger.sh driven directly with synthetic
#             findings. No docker, no engine — these isolate the matching rules
#             from everything else, so a failure names exactly one cause.
#   gate      ci/openapi-compat.sh end to end, which is the only place that can
#             prove "a consumer that cannot run is an error, not an exemption"
#             and "no breaking finding means the ledger is never reached".
#
# Every mutation happens in a throwaway tree. The tracked ledger is copied,
# never edited.
#
# Usage:
#   ./ci/tests/openapi-corrective-ledger.test.sh          # consumer controls only
#   RUN_GATE_CONTROLS=1 ./ci/tests/openapi-corrective-ledger.test.sh
#
# The gate layer needs docker and the real contracts; it is opt-in so the
# matching rules stay testable on a machine without an engine.
