# PR119 — end-to-end proof of the PR117 URL contract. OPTIONAL smoke stage, called by ci/smoke.sh -
# NOT part of the mandatory merge gate (ci/run.sh's `--filter 'Category!=Smoke'` excludes it, same as
# every other Category=Smoke test).
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES, PRECISELY — read this before trusting a green run:
#
#   A REAL, booted Reefin server (Tesserafin.Server.Integration.Tests/EndToEnd/E2eApplicationFactory.cs -
#   a real ffmpeg/ffprobe binary wired in, unlike the rest of that project's TesserafinApplicationFactory,
#   which explicitly skips ffmpeg validation), driven only through its public HTTP surface:
#     POST Playback/Sessions -> GET Playback/Sessions/{id}/Stream -> a real HTTP GET of the URL the
#   descriptor names, asserting it actually serves bytes (or a manifest + segment, for HLS) - not just
#   that the descriptor LOOKS right. This is exactly the gap ci/smoke.sh's own header (and
#   HlsSmokeTests' remarks) named as real and unclosed after PR115d/PR117: "no existing test harness in
#   this repo provisions a library/media item/auth token." tests/Tesserafin.Server.Integration.Tests/EndToEnd/.
#
#   Five scenarios, one real ffmpeg-synthesized H.264/AAC MP4 fixture (the play METHOD is what these
#   tests control via PlaybackConstraints, not the codec - see EndToEndCapabilityPresets' remarks for
#   the exact StreamBuilder mechanics this relies on):
#     1. DirectPlay
#     2. Remux (DirectStream)
#     3. Transcode to HLS - a REAL ffmpeg encode, manifest AND at least one real segment fetched
#     4. An external subtitle sidecar, named on the descriptor and itself fetched
#     5. The PR115c kill switch (PlaybackShadowOptions.Mode flipped away from v2 mid-session) forcing
#        legacy on the very next request, with the URL still servable afterward
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE, AND WHY — a documented, deliberate simplification, not an oversight:
#
#   The library item is seeded directly against the real, booted server's own persistence
#   (ILibraryManager.CreateItems + IMediaStreamRepository.SaveMediaStreams - real EF/SQLite, not
#   mocked; see LibraryItemSeeder's remarks) rather than through a full virtual-folder library scan
#   (RefreshMediaLibraryTask). Driving an actual scan end to end would ALSO close the harness gap, but
#   adds a second large, independently-flaky surface (task scheduling/polling, resolver/naming-
#   convention matching) on top of the one this PR is actually about (the URL contract, not the scan
#   pipeline) - so this script's proof stops at "a real item resolvable/servable exactly like a scanned
#   one would be," not "a real scan produced this item." See LibraryItemSeeder's remarks for the exact
#   real persistence calls this still exercises.
